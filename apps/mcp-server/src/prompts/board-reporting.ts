  const systemMessage = `You are preparing board-level reporting for a nonprofit organization. Your audience is board members — they are strategic leaders, not day-to-day operators. They need clear, concise information they can act on, not raw data dumps.

You have access to the organization's live data through MCP tools. You MUST call these tools to get real numbers.

## CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

1. **NEVER FABRICATE DATA.** Every number must come from an MCP tool result. If data is unavailable, state it clearly with \`[DATA UNAVAILABLE: ...]\`. Board members make governance decisions based on these numbers.

2. **NEVER DISTRIBUTE EXTERNALLY.** You produce drafts for internal review. The ED/staff must review before the packet goes to the board. End every report with a review prompt.

3. **BOARD-APPROPRIATE TONE.** Write for strategic leaders: lead with headlines, explain significance, flag what needs their attention or decision. Avoid operational jargon. If a metric is bad, say so clearly — boards need honest reporting, not spin.

## INTERACTION MODEL

For board packets, you MUST confirm the presentation format, visual template, metrics, and graph preferences with the user BEFORE drafting. Do NOT skip these checkpoints — a board packet that doesn't match the board's expected format wastes everyone's time.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

- **All data tables → CSV format** with labeled filenames (e.g., \`kpi_scorecard.csv\`)
- **Narrative sections → clearly structured text** with headers, suitable for copying into a presentation deck
- **CSV conventions:** raw numeric values (no $ or commas in numbers), first row is headers, double-quote text with commas, dates as YYYY-MM-DD
- Each CSV block labeled: \`--- FILENAME: name.csv ---\``;

  const userMessage = `# Task: BOARD REPORTING — ${args.report_type.toUpperCase().replace(/_/g, ' ')}

**Board meeting:** ${meetingDate}
**Reporting period:** ${period}
**Comparison:** ${comparison}
${hasTargets ? `**KPI targets:** ${args.kpi_targets}` : '**KPI targets:** Derive from budget data and historical performance.'}
${args.committee ? `**Committee:** ${args.committee}` : ''}
${audienceClause}
${extraClause}

## Step 1: Gather All Data

Call these MCP tools in parallel to build a comprehensive data picture.

### Enrollment & program data:
- \`query_enrollment\` with query_type "total" — current headcount
- \`query_enrollment\` with query_type "by_phase" — phase distribution
- \`query_enrollment\` with query_type "by_race" — demographic breakdown
- \`query_enrollment\` with query_type "by_school" — school distribution
- \`query_students\` — population details for narrative

### Outcome data:
- \`query_certifications\` with query_type "summary" — pass rates
- \`query_certifications\` with query_type "by_type" — by certification type
- \`query_employment\` with query_type "aggregate" — employment rates, wages
- \`query_employment\` with query_type "by_employer" — top employers
- \`query_postsecondary\` with query_type "summary" — college enrollment/completion
- \`query_attendance\` with query_type "aggregate" — engagement rates
- \`query_competency\` — skill development metrics if available

### Financial data:
- \`get_finance_brief\` — snapshot
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "ytd" — YTD performance
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "budget_actuals" — budget vs actual
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "fund_balances" — fund health
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "phase_budget_summary" — cost by program

### Fundraising data:
- \`query_donors\` with query_type "summary" — donor base overview
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "dev_giving_history" — giving trends
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "dev_grants_tracker" — active grants
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "dev_prospect_pipeline" — pipeline
- \`query_finances\` with query_type "dev_launchpad_pipeline" — LP-specific pipeline

### Qualitative / context:
- \`search_documents\` with query: "board" or "strategic plan" or "program update" — past reports, strategic context
- \`search_conversations\` with query: "board" or "highlight" or "challenge" — recent team discussions about board-relevant topics

---

## Step 2: Confirm Format, Metrics & Visuals

Before drafting anything, you MUST confirm the presentation format, key metrics, and graph preferences with the user. This ensures the output matches what the board expects.

### 2a. Presentation Template

${hasTemplate ? `The user provided a template description:

> ${args.presentation_template}

Review this template and confirm your understanding: "I'll structure the packet to match your template: [restate the structure]. Is that correct, or should I adjust anything?"` : `**No template was provided.** Present a proposed slide/page structure and ask the user to confirm or modify:

"Before I draft the packet, I need to know the format your board expects. Here's a proposed structure:

**Slide 1:** Cover — meeting date, organization name, reporting period
**Slide 2:** KPI Scorecard — traffic-light status for key metrics
**Slide 3:** Financial Summary — revenue, expenses, net, cash position
**Slide 4:** Budget vs. Actual — bar chart with variance highlights
**Slide 5:** Program Enrollment & Outcomes — by phase
**Slide 6:** Fundraising Progress — vs. annual goal
**Slide 7:** Development Pipeline — active grants and prospects
**Slide 8:** Highlights & Stories — 1-2 student/program highlights
**Slide 9:** Challenges & Risks — honest assessment
**Slide 10:** Items for Board Action — decisions needed
**Slide 11:** Upcoming Calendar — key dates next quarter

Do you have an existing PowerPoint or Google Slides template I should match? If so, please share it (URL or describe the layout — colors, logo placement, slide order, what goes where). Otherwise, confirm this structure works or tell me what to change."

**Wait for the user's response before proceeding.**`}

### 2b. Key Metrics

${hasKeyMetrics ? `The user specified these key metrics (in priority order):

> ${args.key_metrics}

Confirm: "I'll feature these metrics as the primary KPIs in the scorecard: [restate]. I'll also include supporting metrics where relevant. Does this look right?"` : `${hasTargets ? `The user provided KPI targets (${args.kpi_targets}) but didn't specify which metrics to prioritize.` : 'No specific metrics were provided.'}

**Propose a metrics list and ask for confirmation:**

"Which metrics matter most to your board? Here's what I'd recommend based on the data available, in priority order:

**Program Metrics:**
1. Total active enrollment
2. Certification pass rate
3. Employment placement rate
4. Average hourly wage
5. Postsecondary enrollment rate
6. Attendance rate

**Financial Metrics:**
7. Revenue vs. budget
8. Net surplus/deficit
9. Cash on hand / months of runway
10. Program expense ratio

**Fundraising Metrics:**
11. Total raised vs. annual goal
12. Donor count
13. Pipeline value

Please:
- Reorder these by what your board cares about most
- Remove any that aren't relevant
- Add any I'm missing (e.g., specific program outcomes, specific fund balances)
- For each metric, tell me the **target** if you have one (e.g., 'cert pass rate: 85%')"

**Wait for the user's response before proceeding.**`}

### 2c. Graphs & Visualizations

${hasGraphPrefs ? `The user specified these graph preferences:

> ${args.graph_preferences}

Confirm: "I'll describe these visualizations in the output so you can create them: [restate]. Any changes?"` : `**Propose graph types and ask for confirmation:**

"What graphs/charts does your board expect to see? I'll describe each visualization with the exact data so you can create them in your presentation tool. Here's what I'd recommend:

1. **KPI Scorecard** — table with traffic-light color coding (green/yellow/red)
2. **Revenue vs. Budget** — horizontal bar chart (actual vs. budget by category)
3. **Monthly Revenue & Expense Trend** — line chart (12-month trailing)
4. **Enrollment by Phase** — stacked bar or pie chart
5. **Fundraising Progress** — progress bar or gauge (raised vs. goal)
6. **Program Outcomes** — grouped bar chart (cert rate, employment rate, college rate by phase)
7. **Expense Allocation** — pie chart (program vs. admin vs. fundraising)

For each graph, I'll output the underlying data as CSV so you can plug it directly into your charting tool.

Please confirm which charts you want, modify any, or add others."

**Wait for the user's response before proceeding.**`}

---

## Step 3: Build the Report

Use the confirmed format, metrics, and graph preferences from Step 2. Structure the output to match the user's template.

${buildReportTypeInstructions(args)}

### Graph Data

For each confirmed graph/chart, output a dedicated CSV file with the data needed to create it:

\`--- FILENAME: chart_[name].csv ---\`

Each chart CSV should include:
- Column headers that map directly to chart axes/series
- Data sorted in the order it should appear in the chart
- A comment row at the top: \`# Chart Type: [bar/line/pie/gauge], Title: [title], X-Axis: [label], Y-Axis: [label]\`

Example:
\`\`\`
--- FILENAME: chart_revenue_vs_budget.csv ---
\`\`\`
\`\`\`csv
# Chart Type: horizontal bar, Title: Revenue vs Budget (YTD), X-Axis: Category, Y-Axis: Amount
Category,Actual,Budget
"Grants & Contributions",142000,150000
"Government Contracts",85000,80000
"Individual Giving",45000,60000
"Earned Revenue",12000,15000
\`\`\`

---

## Step 4: Final Quality Check

Before outputting, verify:
- [ ] Format matches the user's confirmed template (slide order, sections, branding notes)
- [ ] Only the user's confirmed metrics are featured as primary KPIs
- [ ] Every confirmed graph has a corresponding \`chart_*.csv\` data file
- [ ] Every number comes from a tool call — zero fabricated data
- [ ] All CSV blocks have a labeled filename
- [ ] CSV uses raw numeric values (no $ signs, no commas in numbers)
- [ ] Every \`[DATA UNAVAILABLE]\` flag is collected and listed
- [ ] Narrative is board-appropriate: headlines first, significance explained, action items clear
- [ ] Comparison data is included where available
- [ ] The report period and "as of" date are stated clearly

**"This is a draft for staff review. Please verify all figures and narrative before distributing to the board."**`;

What happened in programs this period. Use real numbers but lead with the human story. If search_documents or search_conversations surfaced a student anecdote, lead with it, then back it up with data.

**3. Financial Position (1-2 paragraphs)**
Plain-language financial summary. Not a P&L — a narrative. "We're on track against our $X budget, with $Y in cash and Z months of runway. Fundraising is at X% of our annual goal." Flag any concerns honestly.

**4. Strategic Progress (1-2 paragraphs)**
Tie the period's work to the strategic plan. What goals are being advanced? What milestones were hit? Reference any relevant documents found in the search.

**5. Challenges & Risks (1 paragraph)**
What's the ED worried about? Enrollment trends, funding gaps, staffing, external factors. Boards respect transparency.

**6. Decisions Needed (bullet list)**
Specific items requiring board input, approval, or discussion. Each bullet should include:
- What the decision is
- Why it's needed now
- The ED's recommendation

**7. Looking Ahead (1 paragraph)**
What's coming in the next quarter: key dates, milestones, opportunities.
